# Augmented Art

Personal Augmented Reality project created with Unity and Vuforia.

This project is an AR application that works with markers. The purpose is that users can scan a marker that is close to a painting (or that is the painting itself) and that the application displays the frame with an animation and three options that users will be able to select, the options would include:
1. Button to take a screenshot.
2. Button to show information regarding the work.
3. Button to show some reference video.
