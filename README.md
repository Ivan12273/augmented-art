# Augmented Art

Personal Augmented Reality project created with Unity and Vuforia.

This project is an AR application that works with markers. The purpose is that users can scan a marker that is close to a painting (or that is the painting itself) and that the application displays the frame with an animation and three options that users will be able to select, the options would include:
1. Button to take a screenshot.
2. Button to show information regarding the work.
3. Button to show some reference video.

Before I started building the program, I had to think about the layout and graphic elements that I would use to present the information to the user.
For the elaboration of the UI designs of the application, I used the [figma](https://www.figma.com/) tool, as a result, the following GUIs were elaborated for the project:

The first thing the user will see when starting the application, I made both the logo and the background with the Krita editing tool.
